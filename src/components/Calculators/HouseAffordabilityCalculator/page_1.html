<h2 id="section-2">1. Executive Summary &amp; Critical Observations</h2>
<p>This document provides a thorough analysis of the House Affordability Calculator, a tool designed to determine a maximum affordable home price based on a user&#39;s financial profile. The analysis is based on a provided Excel file, which outlines a comprehensive methodology rooted in standard lending practices, primarily focusing on the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio. The calculator systematically processes user inputs to deliver a clear affordability snapshot, complete with payment breakdowns and loan amortization details.</p>
<p>The core strength of the calculator lies in its robust, transparent, and multi-faceted approach. It considers all primary components of housing costs—Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance (PITI), and even Homeowners&#39; Association (HOA) dues—providing a realistic monthly payment estimate. However, the example scenario used for this analysis contains significant data anomalies that dramatically skew the results, making them unrealistic for a typical home purchase. These issues are critical to understanding the output.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<h4>Critical Observations &amp; Data Anomalies</h4>
<p>The example scenario presented in the source data contains parameters that are highly unusual for a standard mortgage calculation. These anomalies must be considered when interpreting the results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rate: 70% Annually.</strong> This figure is extraordinarily high and is almost certainly a data entry error. A realistic mortgage rate would typically be in the single digits (e.g., 7.0%). This anomaly is the primary driver of the very high monthly payment relative to the loan amount.</li>
<li><strong>Loan Term: 12 Months.</strong> A standard mortgage term is 15 or 30 years (180 or 360 months). A 12-month term is more akin to a short-term personal loan and results in an extremely rapid, but high, principal paydown.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion on Anomalies:</strong> While these values make the specific financial results of this example impractical, they do not invalidate the underlying calculation methodology. The formulas and workflow remain sound and would produce realistic results if supplied with standard market inputs.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="core-methodology">
<h2 id="section-3">2. Core Methodology of the Calculator</h2>
<p>The calculator&#39;s logic is built upon a sequential workflow that translates high-level financial inputs into a precise home affordability figure. This section deconstructs that methodology into its three core components: the initial parameters, the calculation process, and the underlying financial formulas.</p>
<h3 id="section-input-parameters">2.1. Input Parameters Structure</h3>
<p>The calculation begins with a set of user-defined parameters that form the foundation of the affordability assessment. The following table details the inputs used in the example scenario, sourced from the &#39;Input Parameters&#39; sheet of the provided data.</p>

<h3 id="section-calculation-workflow">2.2. Step-by-Step Calculation Workflow</h3>
<p>The calculator follows a logical, multi-step process to determine the maximum affordable home price. It works backward from the borrower&#39;s income and DTI limit to find the maximum loan they can support, and then adds the down payment to arrive at the final home price.</p>

<h3 id="section-key-formulas">2.3. Key Financial Formulas Employed</h3>
<p>The calculator&#39;s accuracy depends on standard financial formulas. The two most critical formulas are for the monthly mortgage payment and the Debt-to-Income ratio.</p>
<h4>Monthly Payment Formula (Principal &amp; Interest)</h4>
<p>This formula calculates the fixed monthly payment required to fully amortize a loan over its term.</p>
<div class="code-block">
M = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
                </div>
<ul>
<li><strong>M</strong> = Total monthly mortgage payment (P&amp;I)</li>
<li><strong>P</strong> = The principal loan amount</li>
<li><strong>r</strong> = The monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)</li>
<li><strong>n</strong> = The number of payments over the loan&#39;s lifetime (loan term in months)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this calculator&#39;s workflow, this formula is used in reverse (solving for P) to determine the maximum loan amount based on the affordable monthly P&amp;I payment.</p>
<h4>Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio Formula</h4>
<p>DTI is a primary metric used by lenders to assess a borrower&#39;s ability to manage monthly payments and repay debts.</p>
<div class="code-block">
DTI = (Total Monthly Debt Payments / Gross Monthly Income) × 100
                </div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Monthly Debt Payments</strong> includes the proposed new housing payment (PITI + HOA) plus all other existing monthly debts (car loans, student loans, credit card payments).</li>
<li><strong>Gross Monthly Income</strong> is the total income before any taxes or deductions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The calculator uses the DTI as a hard limit (40% in this case) to cap the total monthly payment allowed.</p>
</section>
<section id="financial-analysis">
<h2 id="section-4">3. Financial Breakdown and Analysis</h2>
<p>This section translates the methodological framework into concrete financial results. It details the final affordability figures, breaks down the monthly payment into its constituent parts, and analyzes these figures as percentages of both the total payment and the borrower&#39;s income.</p>
<h3 id="section-affordability-results">3.1. Final Affordability Results</h3>
<p>Based on the inputs and calculations detailed previously, the calculator produced the following top-line affordability results. These figures represent the maximums the borrower can afford under the given constraints.</p>

<strong>Chart 1: Monthly Payment Breakdown.</strong> This chart visualizes the distribution of the $5,846 total monthly payment.
                        <br/>
<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Due to the extremely high interest rate and short loan term, the Principal &amp; Interest portion dominates the payment at 97.02%. In a typical 30-year mortgage, ancillary costs like taxes and insurance would represent a much larger percentage of the total payment.

<h3 id="section-percentage-analysis">3.3. In-Depth Percentage Analysis</h3>
<p>To better understand the financial impact of the mortgage, it&#39;s useful to analyze the payments as percentages. The following tables break down the costs relative to the total monthly payment and the borrower&#39;s gross monthly income.</p>

</tbody></table>
<h3 id="section-dti-analysis">3.4. Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio Analysis</h3>
<p>The Debt-to-Income ratio is the cornerstone of this affordability calculation. It ensures that the borrower&#39;s total debt load remains within a manageable limit defined by the lender. In this scenario, the DTI limit was set to 40%. The calculation works to ensure the final housing payment, when added to existing debts, does not exceed this threshold.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4>Understanding DTI</h4>
<p>Lenders use DTI to measure your ability to manage payments. A lower DTI indicates a good balance between debt and income, posing less risk to the lender. A high DTI can signal that an individual has too much debt for their income level.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Front-End DTI (or Housing Ratio):</strong> Considers only your housing-related costs (PITI+HOA) against your gross monthly income.</li>
<li><strong>Back-End DTI:</strong> Considers all your monthly debt payments (housing, auto loans, credit cards, etc.) against your gross monthly income. This is the more comprehensive and commonly used metric.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="figure">

                        <br/>
<strong>Key Insight:</strong> The analysis confirms that the total debt (Housing Payment + Existing Debts) consumes exactly 40.0% of the gross monthly income, hitting the maximum DTI limit precisely. This leaves the remaining 60% ($9,004) of income available for taxes, savings, and other living expenses.

<strong>Chart 3: Amortization Schedule Over 12 Months.</strong> This chart displays the monthly split between interest and principal payments.
                        <br/>
<strong>Key Insight:</strong> The chart illustrates a rapid transition from interest-heavy to principal-heavy payments. The first payment is nearly 50% interest, but by the final month, interest is a very small fraction of the payment. This accelerated paydown is a direct consequence of the extremely short 12-month loan term. Over the life of this short loan, the total interest paid ($20,073) is approximately 41.8% of the original loan amount ($47,991).

<h2 id="section-7">6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>The House Affordability Calculator employs a robust, industry-standard methodology for determining home affordability. Its systematic approach, which is transparently documented in the provided materials, considers all major housing costs (PITI+HOA) and applies a conservative Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio to ensure the resulting payment is manageable for the borrower.</p>
<p>The calculator&#39;s primary strength lies in its comprehensive structure and detailed documentation. With eight interconnected worksheets covering everything from initial inputs to a full amortization schedule and formula references, the tool is exceptionally thorough. This makes it suitable for both educational purposes—demonstrating the mechanics of mortgage finance—and for practical home affordability assessments.</p>
<p>However, it is imperative to reiterate that the example scenario analyzed in this document contains significant data entry errors, namely a 70% interest rate and a 12-month loan term. These anomalies render the specific output values ($57,991 home price, $5,846 monthly payment) unrealistic. When used with correct, market-appropriate parameters, the calculator&#39;s sound methodology would produce a valid and useful home affordability estimate.</p>
